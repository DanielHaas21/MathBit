# MathBit - `tests`

This package contains the test suites for MathBit, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
These tests test the following functionalities:

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on testing the Haskell engine's core logic, including the basic operations, problem-solving algorithms, error handling, and edge cases. These tests ensure that individual functions and modules work correctly in isolation.

- **Integration Tests**: Test mainly 
together correctly.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Simulate real user interactions with the application, testing the entire system from the frontend to the backend, ensuring that all components work together seamlessly.
