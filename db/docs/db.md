### Workflow

This package works purely as a library, it has no comamnds. All models, functions are exposed to be used elsewhere

Such as:

- Repository functions and Models are called `/controllers` in the **web-api** package
- Migrations have a function that calls all of them, Kysely track which already have been executed
- db.ts exports **initDb()** and **migrateToLatest()** methods which are used in **web-api** initialization file before turning on express routes

### Utilities

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for better code formatting
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
